Week 15: SQL Aggregate Functions

Your promotion to Data Analyst is here! It is time to transform a dataset into insights using SQL and visualise your findings using charts like a data analyst pro. 



The Mission:

1. Data Dive (10 pts):

Pick your dataset and click to download (Social Media Users, Netflix Shows, or Human Stampedes).
Import it into MySQL Workbench (learn how!). 
Briefly explain any difficulties and 1 interesting thing you noticed about your chosen dataset.


2. Data Fun (20 pts):

Use simple SQL queries to play with the data.
Find 2 cool facts hidden within the data (e.g., most popular interests).
Use basic SQL queries like (COUNT, AVG, and SUM) to understand more about the data you have.


3. Ask Away (30 pts):

Formulate 2 questions about the data (e.g., what are popular shows in different countries?).
Write basic SQL queries (WHERE, ORDER BY) to find answers.
Share what you learned from the answers.
